Here I am striving to experiment with the dataset - https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/
which contains different pictures of food.

I am using this dataset to tackle the capabilities of PyTorch and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

First attempt is focused on building a small imperfect sample with only 3 food categories: Sushi, Pizza, Steak.
to understand possible pros and cons of different approaches without killing your computers CPU.

Afterwards I am going to gradually enlarge the model and its working samples.

The ultimate goal is to build a model that is going to be able to identify custom dataset with High Accuracy.
